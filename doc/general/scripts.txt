1. PURPOSE

This document describes scripts present in the project

2. SCRIPTS

gen_coverage.sh
This scripts generates coverage information using lcov. lcov has to be
installed. It works only if you compile with -DUSER_COVERAGE=1. If you recompile
your sources incrementaly, it might happen that it not work - clean the project,
build again, remove the gathered coverage and it should work.

remove_coverage.sh
Remove the gathered coverage.

gen_cscope.sh
This script creates file cscope.files in source root. If you run cscope there,
you will get cscope.out index file, which can be then passed to your editor like
vim to provide cross-reference.

gen_version.sh
This script is used internally by the build system. You should not use it
manually. It gathers some information about the repository and system.

remove_ignored.sh
This script removes all the files which are ignored by cmake i.e. compiled
binaries, cscope files, cmake caches, coverage result, unit tests results and so
on. It is useful if you fight with cmake.
